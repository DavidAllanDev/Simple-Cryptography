# Simple-Cryptography
A Simple Cryptography project that uses the cipherMode to do it

This projects is intended to be a demo of using cipher to encrypt and
decrypt strings by using a pass phrase

To open all projects in the solution, use the solution file located in "..\SimpleCryptography\SimpleCryptography.sln"
so you'll be able to see the projects:
SimpleCryptography  (witch has the cipher main features);
SimpleCryptographyConsole that uses the SimpleCryptography to create its own way to encrypt/decrypt;
and UnitTest_SimpleCryptography to test and toknow how to cosume those projects above
